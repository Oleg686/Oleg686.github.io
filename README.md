Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Oleg Zhobitenko, this is my portfolio, it contains additional information.
About me: In recent years I have been studying without the opportunity to work. At the moment, I finished my internship after the 3rd year, the last 4 year of college remained.

I am looking for a job in the profile to gain experience and practical knowledge, with the possibility of further long-term and mutually beneficial cooperation. I am sure I will be (as soon as possible) useful to the team.

Hardworking, inclined to a systematic approach, stress-resistant, I love and know how to work in a team.

Knowledge of the language: Graduated from the English special school. I understand by ear, I talk, I can correspond.

I don't smoke, I don't drink, I do sports
